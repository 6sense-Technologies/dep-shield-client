Depshield is a powerful tool designed for analyzing and monitoring the security and integrity of your code repositories. It checks for vulnerabilities, limitations, and dependencies across different branches. Users can scan repositories to retrieve and analyze data, ensuring secure and optimized development.

## Features

- **Dependency Analysis:** Identify and track dependencies within your project.
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Detect security vulnerabilities and limitations in dependencies.
- **Branch Monitoring:** Scan and retrieve data from repositories efficiently.

## Branching Strategy

- **Test Branch:** Used for internal testing.
- **Beta Branch:** Used for client testing.
- **Development Branch:** Uses the naming convention `depshield-client-vX.00.00X`, where X changes based on iteration.

## Configuration

- The backend URLs and important keys/tokens are stored in the `.env` file.
- After modifying the `.env` file, export the values from `config.ts` for proper integration.
- An `.env.example` file is provided to illustrate the `.env` file structure.

## Technologies Used

- **Framework:** Next.js
- **Forms & Validation:** React Hook Form, Zod
- **UI Components:** Shadcn
- **Networking:** Axios
- **State Management:** TanStack Query
- **Icons:** Lucide Icons
- **Authentication:** Auth.js
- **Testing:** Jest, Playwright
- **Code Quality Monitoring:** Codecy

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

## Deployment

The recommended deployment platform is **Vercel**. Refer to the [Next.js Deployment Guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

### Deploying with Vercel CLI

1. Install Vercel CLI if you havenâ€™t already:
   
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. Login to Vercel:
   
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

   Follow the prompts to authenticate with your Vercel account.

3. Navigate to your project directory and deploy:
   
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

   This will initialize the deployment process and prompt you with options.

4. For deploying updates, use:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Deploying to Development and Preview Environments

- **Development Environment:**
  
  ```bash
  vercel --env development
  ```
  
  This helps in testing changes before pushing them to production.

- **Preview Deployment:**
  
  ```bash
  vercel --pre
  ```
  
  This will deploy the branch as a preview, which can be shared and tested before going live.

### Assigning a Custom Domain

- **Add your domain to Vercel:**
  
  ```bash
  vercel domains add yourdomain.com
  ```

- **Update your DNS settings** by following the instructions provided by Vercel.

- **Set the domain for production:**
  
  ```bash
  vercel alias yourdeploymenturl yourdomain.com
  ```

- **Verify the domain:**
  
  ```bash
  vercel domains inspect yourdomain.com
  ```

### Logging Out

To log out of the Vercel CLI:

```bash
vercel logout
```
